## Assignments

### 3D Animation Class
- 1st week: Animate a box (that's the jumping box)

### 3D Modeling Class
- 2nd week: Model three keyholes at different difficulty levels, easy, medium, hard (utilized in the environment)

## Tools

- Blender (topic of this class)
- Affinity Photo (not part of this class)
- Three.js (not part of this class)

## Notes

- This is based on a 3D Animation class I am attending at Santiago Canyon College in Orange, CA.
- I embellished this work beyond the scope of the original assignment, just to give it more appeal. For instance, materials, backgrounds and lighting were not allowed in these assignments. They had to be submitted in default gray with nothing but the geometry.
